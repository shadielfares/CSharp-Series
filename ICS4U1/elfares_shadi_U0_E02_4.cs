int year = 2023, month = 2, day = 10;

Console.WriteLine(year + "/" + '0' + month + "/" + day);

//The assignment states set the day equal to 10 but output the day as 20, I went with 10 as that was your original request.
// This program takes the set variables: year, month, and day and outputs them to the terminal in one statement in chronological order.
